# quiz_properties_access
Drupal Quiz Addon: Provides a permission to edit a quiz's properties on its node edit form.

#Information
The default behavior of the Quiz module is to allow whoever can edit the Quiz Content Type to change the quiz's properties.
This module controls access to edit the quiz's properties on the node edit form, through a role based permission.

Note: If a user can't access the quiz properties, and creates a new quiz, that quiz will use the default properties.
